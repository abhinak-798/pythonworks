#2.# A toy vendor supplies three types of toys:
# Battery Based Toys, Key-based Toys, and Electrical Charging Based Toys.

# The vendor gives a discount of 10% on orders for battery-based toys if the order is for more than Rs. 1000.

# On orders of more than Rs. 100 for key-based toys,a discount of 5% is given,

# and a discount of 10% is given on orders for electrical charging based toys of value more than Rs. 500.

# Assume that the numeric codes 1,2 and 3 are used for battery based toys, key-based toys, and electrical charging based toys respectively.
